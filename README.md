# Neuro App – Flutter Internship (Week 1)
## Week 1: Dart Programming Fundamentals

This repository contains tasks completed during **Week 1** of the **Neuro App Flutter Internship**, focusing on **Dart programming basics, collections, OOP, and asynchronous programming**.

### Tasks Completed

#### Task 1.1 – Dart Setup & Basic Syntax
- Created Dart project `dart_basics` with `main.dart`
- Demonstrated variables, data types (`int`, `double`, `String`, `bool`), and operators
- Implemented control flow: `if-else`, `switch`, `for`, `while` loops
- Created functions for:
  - Sum
  - Factorial (recursive)
  - Prime number check
- Ran all programs successfully using `dart main.dart`

#### Task 1.2 – Dart Collections & Higher-Order Functions
- Demonstrated List, Set, and Map operations
- Implemented `map()`, `where()`, `reduce()`, and `forEach()`
- Created a **student management system** with List of Maps
- Implemented sorting, filtering, and searching operations

#### Task 1.3 – Object-Oriented Programming in Dart
- Created classes: `User`, `Admin`, `Product`, `ShoppingCart`
- Implemented:
  - Encapsulation (private variables)
  - Inheritance (`Admin` extends `User`)
  - Polymorphism (method overriding)
  - Abstraction (`Animal` abstract class with `Dog` and `Cat`)
- Implemented getters, setters, and constructors
- Tested all functionality in `main()`

#### Task 1.4 – Asynchronous Programming
- Demonstrated Futures, async-await, and Streams in `dart_async.dart`
- Implemented:
  - Simulated API calls with delays
  - Async function with `try-catch` error handling
  - Parallel execution with `Future.wait()`
  - Stream emitting integers with error handling
  - StreamController with transformation (`map()`)
- Tested all async operations
